## **Features**

- Send messages between two blockchain chains
- User-friendly interface with dark mode support
- Integration with Axelar General Message Passing
- Real-time response and message status updates

## **Installation**

To install and run this application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone 
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd javascript-in-web3-demo
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Navigate to the hardhat directory:

   ```bash
   cd hardhat
   ```

5. Set up the environment variables to deploy the smart contracts:

   - Create a `.env` file in the hardhat directory.
   - Define the following variables in the `.env` file:
     ```apache
      PRIVATE_KEY=<Your Wallet Private Key>
     ```
     Replace `<Your Wallet Private Key>` with your wallet private key.
   - Run the following command to install the hardhat dependencies:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```

6. Compile and Deploy the smart contracts:

   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network <network>
   ```

   Replace `<network>` with the desired network (e.g. `fantom` and `avalanche` in this case). Copy the contract address once the deployment is complete.

   > Ensure you update the Axelar gateway and gas service address for Fantom and Avalanche respectively in `deploy.js` file under the `scripts` directory and deploy them seperately. You can find the gateway and gas service address [here](https://docs.axelar.dev/resources/testnet).

7. Set up the environment variables:

   - Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory.
   - Define the following variables in the `.env.local` file:
     ```apache
     NEXT_PUBLIC_FANTOM_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=<Fantom contract address>
     NEXT_PUBLIC_AVALANCHE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=<Avalanche contract address>
     NEXT_PUBLIC_AVALANCHE_RPC_URL=https://avalanche-fuji-c-chain.publicnode.com
     ```
     Replace `<Fantom contract address>` and `<Avalanche contract address>`, with the respective values.

8. Start the development server:

```bash
cd ..
npm run dev
```

9.  Access the application in your browser:

Open your web browser and visit [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000) to see the application running.
